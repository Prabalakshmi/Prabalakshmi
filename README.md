# Hey, I'm Praba 👋  

⚡ ECE grad student @ Boise State University.  
🔧 I tinker with **chips, circuits, and code** — Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM, Cadence, Python, and friends.  
🧪 Built things like low-noise neural amplifiers, DRAM-based ALUs, and PWM modules (because why not?).  
💻 Ex-Software Engineer @ Dish Network (made servers faster so you could binge-watch smoother).  

I like building stuff that actually *works* (after 100 simulations).
